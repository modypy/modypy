A DC-Motor with Propeller
=========================

Until now, we have created our states individually and referenced them directly.
However, in practical simulation you might want to define reusable building
blocks and connect their inputs and outputs dynamically.

For example, when analysing
`multicopter dynamics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadcopter>`_ we might want
to have a reusable block for an engine consisting of a DC-motor and a propeller.
We might want to provide individual voltages to individual motors and use an
atmospheric model to determine the density of the air based on altitude.
We might want to sum up the thrust and torque generated by the engines to
determine the total force and torque acting on the multicopter and finally feed
that into some reusable block for rigid-body motion.

In this example, we will define re-usable building blocks for a DC-motor and a
propeller, and assemble them to a DC-engine. We will then simulate a step-
response of such a motor and plot the results. At the end of this exercise, you
will know

- how to define ports as placeholders for signals,
- how to connect ports to signals,
- how to define reusable building blocks for systems, and
- how to use :class:`signal states <modypy.model.states.SignalState>`.

Again, we start by importing everything we need:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    from modypy.model import System, State, Signal, SignalState, Block, Port
    from modypy.blocks.sources import constant
    from modypy.simulation import Simulator

Creating A DC-Motor Model
-------------------------

A DC motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy by a rotating
magnetic field. It consists of a rotor and a stator, where a number of magnets
are fixed to the rotor and the status contains a number of coils which can be
switched on and off individually and the polarity of which can be changed over
time. By switching the coils, a rotating magnetic field is generated which leads
the rotor to move.

The change in torque generated by the coil is typically proportional to the
current running through the coil. It is counteracted by the torque due to
acceleration of the load :math:`J \frac{d\omega}{dt}`, with :math:`J` being the
moment of inertia of the load, and the external load :math:`\tau\left(t\right)`,
which in our case is mainly due to the aerodynamic drag of the propeller we will
be turning.

So our first set of equations of motion for the DC-motor is:

.. math::
    \omega\left(t_0\right) &= \omega_0 \\
    \frac{d}{dt} \omega\left(t\right) &=
    \frac{K_v i\left(t\right) - \tau\left(t\right)}{J}

Here, :math:`K_v` is the motor-constant of the motor, which describes the
linear relationship between generated torque and current.

On the electrical side, the coil has internal resistance :math:`R` and
inductance :math:`L`, both of which typically cannot be neglected. Also, because
the magnetic field is turning around the coil, a voltage is induced. This
voltage is proportional to the angular velocity of the magnetic field and thus
the rotor. Considering the preservation of energy for the electrical and the
mechanical part of the motor, we can conclude that the factor of proportionality
between velocity and that induced voltage is also :math:`K_v`.

The coil also has an input voltage :math:`u\left(t\right)`. Using Kirchhoff's
Laws we get the following equations for the electrical side:

.. math::
    i\left(t_0\right) &= i_0 \\
    \frac{d}{dt} i\left(t\right) &=
    \frac{u\left(t\right) - R i\left(t\right) - K_v \omega\left(t\right)}{L}

Now, let us define a block for this DC-motor. In the constructor, we first store
all the model parameters, such as the motor constant or the inductance.

.. code-block:: python

    class DCMotor(Block):
        def __init__(self,
                     parent,
                     motor_constant,
                     resistance,
                     inductance,
                     moment_of_inertia,
                     initial_speed=None,
                     initial_current=None):
            Block.__init__(self, parent)
            self.motor_constant = motor_constant
            self.resistance = resistance
            self.inductance = inductance
            self.moment_of_inertia = moment_of_inertia

In the next step, we create our states:

.. code-block:: python

            # Create the velocity and current state
            # These can also be used as signals which export the exact value of
            # the respective state.
            self.omega = SignalState(self,
                                     derivative_function=self.omega_dt,
                                     initial_condition=initial_speed)
            self.current = SignalState(self,
                                       derivative_function=self.current_dt,
                                       initial_condition=initial_speed)

There are three major difference to what we did earlier when defining states:

- Instead of :class:`modypy.model.states.State` instances we use
  :class:`modypy.model.states.SignalState` instances. These are states which also
  double as signals. The value of the respective signal is simply the value of
  the state. We use signal states instead of signals when we want to use the
  state also as input for some other block.
- The first parameter to the constructor is now the instance of the block instead
  of the system. This first parameter is the *owner* of the state or signal and
  both the systems and blocks may be owners of states and signals.
- As derivative function we specify *bound object methods*. These have access to
  both the current values of all states and signals of the block, but also to
  any instance variables, such as our model parameters.

Now we define some additional output signals of the block:

.. code-block:: python

            # Create the output for the speed in revolutions per second
            self.speed_rps = Signal(self,
                                    value=self.speed_rps_value)

            # Create the output for the generated torque
            self.torque = Signal(self,
                                 value=self.torque_value)

While the state ``omega`` holds the angular speed in radians per time-unit
(usually: seconds), the ``speed_rps`` signal provides it in revolutions per
time-unit. In addition, we provide the total torque generated by the motor. This
is the torque that acts on the motor mount and thereby on the frame.

Finally, we need some way to determine the input voltage and the external load
acting on the motor axle. We do that by introducing two
:class:`port <modypy.model.ports.Port>` instances. Ports are place-holder objects
that can be connected to signals. We will use them to access the value of whatever
signal will be connected to them later.

.. code-block:: python

            # Create (input) ports for voltage and external torque load
            self.voltage = Port(self)
            self.external_load = Port(self)

What is missing are the definitions of the derivative functions and the signal
values:

.. code-block:: python

        def omega_dt(self, data):
            return ((self.motor_constant * data.states[self.current]
                     - data.signals[self.external_load]) /
                    self.moment_of_inertia)

        def current_dt(self, data):
            return ((data.signals[self.voltage]
                     - self.resistance * data.states[self.current]
                     - self.motor_constant * data.states[self.omega]) /
                    self.inductance)

        def speed_rps_value(self, data):
            return data.signals[self.omega] / (2*np.pi)

        def torque_value(self, data):
            return self.motor_constant * data.states[self.current]

Note that we did not have to define signal output functions for our states
``omega`` and ``current``. That work is done for us by using the
:class:`modypy.model.states.SignalState` class.

A Static Propeller Model
------------------------

The second part of our engine is the propeller. We will use a static propeller
model, as we will assume that the forward velocity of our engine through the air
is small compared to the velocity of our propeller tips.

Our propeller has no internal state, it just generates thrust and requires torque
to overcome it aerodynamic drag. The formulae for this are given as follows:

.. math::
    F\left(n, \rho\right) &= c_t \rho D^4 n^2 \\
    \tau\left(n, \rho\right) &= \frac{c_p}{2 \pi} \rho D^5 n^3

These formulae are derived from the
`standard propeller formulae <https://m-selig.ae.illinois.edu/props/propDB.html>`_,
which specify thrust and power based on

- the thrust coefficient :math:`c_t`,
- the power coefficient :math:`c_p`, and
- the diameter :math:`D` of the propeller.

As parameters, the rotation speed :math:`n` and the air density :math:`\rho` are
required.

So, we define our static propeller block:

.. code-block:: python

    class StaticPropeller(Block):
        def __init__(self,
                     parent,
                     thrust_coefficient,
                     power_coefficient,
                     diameter):
            Block.__init__(self, parent)
            self.thrust_coefficient = thrust_coefficient
            self.power_coefficient = power_coefficient
            self.diameter = diameter

            # Define the thrust and torque output signals
            self.thrust = Signal(self,
                                 value=self.thrust_output)
            self.torque = Signal(self,
                                 value=self.torque_output)

            # Define the input ports for propeller speed and air density
            self.speed_rps = Port(self)
            self.density = Port(self)

        def thrust_output(self, data):
            rho = data.signals[self.density]
            n = data.signals[self.speed_rps]
            return self.thrust_coefficient * rho * self.diameter**4 * n**2

        def torque_output(self, data):
            rho = data.signals[self.density]
            n = data.signals[self.speed_rps]
            return self.power_coefficient / (2 * np.pi) * \
                   rho * self.diameter ** 5 * n ** 2

Nothing new here.

Building an Engine Block
------------------------

Finally, let us assemble an engine block from our motor and our propeller.
The engine block shall provide thrust and total torque of the engine as outputs
and accept the voltage and the air density as inputs. We will interconnect the
DC-motor and the propeller internally, by providing the speed of the DC-motor
to the propeller as its turning speed and by providing the torque load of the
propeller as external load to the DC-motor.

For our engine block, we first create the elements -- the motor and the propeller
-- and make everything visible to the outside that needs to be:

.. code-block:: python

    class Engine(Block):
        def __init__(self,
                     parent,
                     thrust_coefficient,
                     power_coefficient,
                     diameter,
                     motor_constant,
                     resistance,
                     inductance,
                     moment_of_inertia):
            Block.__init__(self, parent)

            # Create the DC motor and the propeller
            self.dc_motor = DCMotor(self,
                                    motor_constant=motor_constant,
                                    resistance=resistance,
                                    inductance=inductance,
                                    moment_of_inertia=moment_of_inertia)
            self.propeller = StaticPropeller(self,
                                             thrust_coefficient=thrust_coefficient,
                                             power_coefficient=power_coefficient,
                                             diameter=diameter)

            # We will simply pass through the voltage and density ports of the
            # motor and the propeller
            self.voltage = self.dc_motor.voltage
            self.density = self.propeller.density

            # We also pass on the thrust and the torque of the whole engine
            self.thrust = self.propeller.thrust
            self.torque = self.dc_motor.torque

Now we need to connect the speed output of the motor to the speed input of the
propeller. For that, we use the ``connect`` method of the
:class:`Port <modypy.model.ports.Port>` class:

.. code-block:: python

            # The propeller needs to know the speed of the motor axle
            self.dc_motor.speed_rps.connect(self.propeller.speed_rps)

            # The DC-motor needs to know the torque required by the propeller
            self.propeller.torque.connect(self.dc_motor.external_load)

Now, the ports and signals are properly connected. Finally, it's time to put it
all together.

Putting it all together
-----------------------

What we still need is a way of providing the voltage and the air density. We
will simply use constants for these, which we can create using the
``constant`` function from the :mod:`modypy.blocks.sources` module.

So, let us create our system:

.. code-block:: python

    # Create the system and the engine
    system = System()
    engine = Engine(system,
                    motor_constant=789.E-6,
                    resistance=43.3E-3,
                    inductance=1.9E-3,
                    moment_of_inertia=5.284E-6,
                    thrust_coefficient=0.09,
                    power_coefficient=0.04,
                    diameter=8*25.4E-3)

    # Provide constant signals for the voltage and the air density
    voltage = constant(system, value=3.5)
    density = constant(system, value=1.29)

    # Connect them to the corresponding inputs of the engine
    engine.voltage.connect(voltage)
    engine.density.connect(density)

Note how we use the ``constant`` function to create signals with constant values
for our voltage and density.

Now, our system is fully assembled. Let's run a simulation:

.. code-block:: python

    simulator = Simulator(system, start_time=0.0)
    msg = simulator.run_until(time_boundary=0.5)

    if msg is not None:
        print("Simulation failed with message '%s'" % msg)
    else:
        # Plot the result
        plt.plot(simulator.result.time,
                 simulator.result.signals[:, engine.thrust.signal_slice])
        plt.title("Engine with DC-Motor and Static Propeller")
        plt.xlabel("Time")
        plt.ylabel("Thrust")
        plt.savefig("05_dc_engine_simulation.png")
        plt.show()

That's it. The result is shown in :numref:`dc_engine_simulation`.

.. _dc_engine_simulation:
.. figure:: 05_dc_engine_simulation.png
    :align: center
    :alt: DC-Engine simulation

    DC-Engine simulation

We can now reuse the blocks that we created in other models and make as many
instances of them as we like. Building a multicopter has never been so easy and
cheap!
