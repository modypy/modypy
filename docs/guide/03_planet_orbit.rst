Multi-Dimensional States: A Planet Orbit
========================================

In this exercise we will model the system of a sun and a planet orbiting around
it. We will model the two-dimensional position and velocity of the planet.
After completing this exercise, you will know

- how to model systems with multi-dimensional states and
- how to specify integrator options.

Deriving the Equations
----------------------

In :numref:`planet_orbit` you can see a schematic drawing of the sun and the
orbiting planet together with the position and the velovity of the planet.

    Sun and Planet with governing quantities

Thanks to Isaac Newton, we know that the gravitational force acting on the
planet has the magnitude

.. math::
    F = G \frac{m M}{r^2}

where

- :math:`M` is the mass of the sun,
- :math:`m` is the mass of the planet,
- :math:`r` is the distance of the planet from the sun, and
- :math:`G` is the gravitational constant, with a value of approximately
  :math:`6.67\times 10^{-11} \frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{kg}\text{s}^2}`.

Thus, the acceleration of the planet is given by:

.. math::
    \frac{d}{dt} \vec{v}\left(t\right) =
    - G \frac{M}{\left|\vec{x}\left(t\right)\right|^2}
    \frac{\vec{x}\left(t\right)}{\left|\vec{x}\left(t\right)\right|}

And again, we have the time-derivative of the position equal the velocity:

.. math::
    \frac{d}{dt} \vec{x}\left(t\right) = \vec{v}\left(t\right)

With the initial conditions :math:`\vec{v}\left(t_0\right)=\vec{v}_0` and
:math:`\vec{x}\left(t_0\right)=\vec{x}_0` our system is defined. So now let us
implement it.

Defining our System
-------------------

Again, we first import the required modules:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import numpy.linalg as linalg
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    from modypy.blocks.linear import integrator
    from modypy.model import System, State
    from modypy.simulation import Simulator

We will need ``numpy.linalg`` to determine the norm of the position vector.

Following that we will define the system parameters and the initial states:

.. code-block:: python

    # Define the system parameters
    G = 6.67E-11*(24*60*60)**2
    SUN_MASS = 1.989E30
    PLANET_ORBIT = 149.6E09
    PLANET_ORBIT_TIME = 365.256

    # Define the initial state
    PLANET_VELOCITY = 2 * np.pi * PLANET_ORBIT / PLANET_ORBIT_TIME
    X_0 = np.c_[PLANET_ORBIT, 0]
    V_0 = 0.9*PLANET_VELOCITY * np.c_[np.sin(np.deg2rad(20)), np.cos(np.deg2rad(20))]

Note that we have scaled up the times to days to make them a bit more manageable.

Now let us define the system, its states and state derivatives:

.. code-block:: python

    # Create the system
    system = System()


    # Define the derivatives
    def velocity_dt(data):
        """Calculate the derivative of the velocity"""
        pos = position(data)
        distance = linalg.norm(pos)
        return -G * SUN_MASS/(distance**3) * pos


    # Create the states
    velocity = State(system,
                     shape=2,
                     derivative_function=velocity_dt,
                     initial_condition=V_0)
    position = integrator(system, input_signal=velocity, initial_condition=X_0)

The main thing that changed from the previous examples is that now our states
are two-dimensional. In that case, ``modypy`` will provide their values as
actual ``numpy`` arrays or vectors in this case.

Running the Simulation
----------------------

Finally, let us set up a simulation, run it and plot the results:

.. code-block:: python

    # Run a simulation
    simulator = Simulator(system,
                          start_time=0.0,
                          integrator_options={
                              "rtol": 1E-6
                          })
    msg = simulator.run_until(time_boundary=PLANET_ORBIT_TIME)

    if msg is not None:
        print("Simulation failed with message '%s'" % msg)
    else:
        # Plot the result
        trajectory = simulator.result[position]
        plt.plot(trajectory[:, 0], trajectory[:, 1])
        plt.title("Planet Orbit")
        plt.savefig("03_planet_orbit_simulation.png")
        plt.show()

This time, we do not plot the values of the states over time, but instead we
plot the trajectory. The result can be seen in :numref:`planet_orbit_simulation`.

Note the additional parameter ``integrator_options`` to the
:class:`Simulator <modypy.simulation.Simulator>` constructor. It is a dictionary
of options which are to be passed to the constructor of the integrator being used.
The ``rtol`` parameter increases the relative tolerance of the integration result
to reduce the time til the simulator is done. For the planetary orbit, we do not
need sub-meter resolution. The value of ``rtol`` given here still allows us to
calculate the orbit positions and velocities to around 1,000 km or 1,000 km/d
accuracy.

If you want, you can now play around a bit with the initial state or any of the
other parameters.
