Linearizing the Water Tank
==========================

In the previous exercise we said that steady states can be used to linearize
systems around given operating points. In this exercise we will do just that
with our tank example.

We reuse the code from the previous exercise. However, now we also need the
function :func:`system_jacobian <modypy.linearization.system_jacobian>`, so
we will extend our imports:

.. code-block:: python

    from modypy.linearization import system_jacobian,\
        LinearizationConfiguration,\
        OutputDescriptor

We set up an instance of :class:`LinearizationConfiguration
<modypy.linearization.LinearizationConfiguration>` to specify at what point we
want to perform the linearization and which ports we are interested in as
outputs:

.. code-block:: python

    # Set up the configuration for finding the system jacobian
    jacobian_config = LinearizationConfiguration(system,
                                                 state=result.state,
                                                 inputs=result.inputs)
    # We want to have the height as output
    output_1 = OutputDescriptor(jacobian_config, height_state)

The :class:`OutputDescriptor <modypy.linearization.OutputDescriptor>` objects
provides us with information about where in the output and feed-through matrices
the respective output is represented.

Then we call the `system_jacobian`-function:

.. code-block:: python

    # Find the system jacobian at the steady state
    jac_A, jac_B, jac_C, jac_D = system_jacobian(jacobian_config,
                                                 single_matrix=False)
    print("Linearization at steady-state point:")
    print("A=%s" % jac_A)
    print("B=%s" % jac_B)
    print("C=%s" % jac_C)
    print("D=%s" % jac_D)

Running the example again, we get this output:

.. code-block::

    Target height: 5.000000
    Steady state height: 5.000000
    Steady state inflow: 19.809153
    Steady state derivative: [3.22346662e-06]
    Theoretical steady state inflow: 19.809089
    Linearization at steady-state point:
    A=[[-0.0990504]]
    B=[[0.05]]
    C=[[1.]]
    D=[[0.]]

The matrices :math:`A`, :math:`B`, :math:`C` and :math:`D` represent a linear
dynamical system where the state is :math:`\delta h\left(t\right)` and the input
is :math:`\delta v_1\left(t\right)`. These represent the difference between the
actual height and inflow velocity and those at the steady-state point:

.. math::
    \delta h\left(t\right) &= h\left(t\right) - h_0 \\
    \delta v_1\left(t\right) &= v_1\left(t\right) - v_{1,0}

As we can see from :math:`A`, the time derivative of the height is negatively
correlated with the height itself, i.e. the higher the height, the faster the
water flows out.
The matrix :math:`B` tell us that we can increase the derivative of the height
by increasing the inflow.

The matrices :math:`C` and :math:`D` describe the relationship of our state and
input signals to the value of the output ports.
Clearly, our output is the height difference, and the inflow velocity does not
directly influence it.
