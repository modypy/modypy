SimTree is a Python package for hierarchical modelling and simulation of linear and non-linear dynamical systems in [state-space representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-space_representation).

Its main features:

   - hierarchical modelling, building models from atomic and composite blocks
   - simulator for continuous-time, linear and non-linear systems
   - model compilation for resolving hierarchical connections and dependencies, useful for simulation, code generation or other analysis
   - tested for 100% statement and branch coverage

SimTree was inspired by [simupy](https://github.com/simupy/simupy) developed by Ben Margolis.
